Your UO account has been compromised.  You need to visit UO's {{website-name}}
at http://www.scam.com and fill out the form.  If you don't, it's very likely
all your {{noun}} will be stolen!  If you have any questions, call us
{{adverb}}.

Note: the form will request you to provide us with
{{sensitive-information-bullet-point}}.  Normally we'll never ask for this kind
of information, but this is a {{desperation-adjective}} situation.  Trust us;
we are professionals, after all.
