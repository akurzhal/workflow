About the scam generator
-----

This started as just a 419 scam generator but then I realized it could be way
more awesome as a multipurpose general scam generator!  419 scams are where the
money is at, though, so we should focus on them.

A [419 scam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/419_scams) is a type of scam that
involves convincing somebody to pay money in order to secure a larger amount
of money.

It's awesome because you only need a few dozen responses to make a lot of
money.  And with your help, we'll have the world's first truly foolproof scam
generator, allowing us to scam the same person literally billions of times
due to the word-list variation possibilities.
