{{salutation}}!

{{introduction-sentence}}.

I tracked you down on {{website-name}}.  You do not know me, but my name is
{{first-name}} {{last-name}} and I am in {{desperation-adjective}} need of assistance!  My
{{relation-type}}, {{first-name->$deceased}}, whom I'm certain you knew well,
was a very wealthy {{noun}} {{profession}} who was murdered by business
associates who had been threatening our family for over {{number}} years.

Before the tragedy, I was told of a large sum of money ({{dollar-amount}}) left
in a {{account-adjective}} account in a local Bank in {{country}}, and that my name was
set as the next of kin in deposit of the fund.

You are undoubtedly aware of your good friend's death, and perhaps of the vast
fortune left behind, but you may not be aware that our Prime Minister here in
{{country}} has prevented our family from the inheritance.

Please you must help us!  As you were so close to {{$deceased}}, and the local
authorities are {{adverb}} corrupt, you are the only hope we can have!!

We know you are very busy and will compensate you with a "{{number}}% commission" as it
were.  We are honourably seeking your assistance in the following ways.

1) To provide a Bank account where this money would be transferred to.

2) To serve as the guardian of this since I am just {{number}} years of age.

{{closing-sentence}}

1) Your name in full
2) Your Bank name
3) Your Bank account numbers
4) Your {{relation-type}}'s maiden name
5) {{sensitive-information-bullet-point}}
